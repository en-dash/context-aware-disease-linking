\textbf{Motivation:} This section should specifically state the scientific question within the context of the field of study.\\
\textbf{Results:} This section should summarize the scientific advance or novel results of the study, and its impact on computational biology.\\
\textbf{Availability and Implementation:} This section should state software availability if the paper focuses mainly on software development or on the implementation of an algorithm. Examples are: 'Freely available on the web at \url{http://www.example.org}'; 'Website implemented in Perl, MySQL and Apache, with all major browsers supported'; or 'Source code and binaries freely available for download at URL, implemented in C++ and supported on linux and MS Windows'. The complete address (URL) should be given. If the manuscript describes new software tools or the implementation of novel algorithms the software must be freely available to non-commercial users. Authors must also ensure that the software is available for a full TWO YEARS following publication. The editors of Bioinformatics encourage authors to make their source code available and, if possible, to provide access through an open source license (see www.opensource.org for examples).\\

\section{Introduction}

introduce task (linking vs. NER)

discuss state of the art (nobody uses context!)



\section{Materials and methods}

\subsection{Datasets}

We evaluated the proposed system using two annotated document collections.
The ShARe corpus consists of clinical reports with annotations for diseases and disorders, which were created for the ShARe/CLEF eHealth Evaluation Lab 2013 shared task \citep{pradhan-et-al:2013:CLEF}.
The NCBI disease corpus \citep{islamaj-dogan-et-al:2014} provides disease annotations over abstracts of scientific articles.
Both collections include references to the relevant mentions in their original context and link them to identifiers of a standard knowledge base.
In both cases, a predefined division into training and test set allows comparison across different approaches.
More detailed statistics on the datasets are given in Table~\ref{tab:datasets}.

The ShARe corpus contains de-identified clinical reports from US intensive care.
It is distributed as part of the MIMIC database  % TODO: reference
and is available for research purposes after acquiring a personal license.%
\footnote{Instructions for obtaining the data are given on the shared-task website, currently hosted at \url{https://sites.google.com/site/shareclefehealth/data}.}
The annotated mentions are grounded in the SNOMED CT terminology  % TODO: reference
using UMLS  % TODO: reference
identifiers (CUI).
Concepts that were not represented in SNOMED at the time of annotation were given the NIL symbol “CUI-less”.

The NCBI disease corpus comprises scientific abstracts and annotations which are freely available online.
In addition to the training and test set, a predetermined development set is provided (regarded as part of the training set in Table~\ref{tab:datasets}).
The mentions are linked to the MEDIC vocabulary  % TODO: reference
using MeSH  % TODO: reference
and OMIM  % TODO: reference
identifiers.
Unlike the ShARe corpus, the NCBI annotators were required to always provide an identifier, \ie there is no NIL label.
Furthermore, they were asked to map a mention to multiple identifiers if there was no single terminology entry that sufficiently covered the meaning of the concept in question.
As another difference, composite mentions such as “breast and ovarian cancer” are represented as a single annotation with a series of identifiers, whereas the ShARe corpus uses multiple, partially overlapping annotations (“breast [\dots] cancer” and “ovarian cancer”).

head1 & head2 & head3 & head4\\\midrule

row2 & row2 & row2 & row2\\
row3 & row3 & row3 & row3\\
row4 & row4 & row4 & row4\\\botrule
\end{tabular}}{}
\end{table}


\subsection{System architecture}

Describe architecture:
based on \cite{lihaodi-et-al:2017}, but without the rule-based system --
we use candidate generators instead (3 types) --
in addition to Li et al., we use context (whole abstract/report and dict definitions)

Detailed description:
network layers (graphic!) --
candidate generators (surface sim., semantic sim., rule-inspired) --
context encoding (simple)



\section{Results}

ShARe/CLEF: better than Li et al. and D'Souza \& Ng.

NCBI: better than Li et al., but we didn't beat TaggerOne
(where do these 88.8\% come from? -- no answer from Li et al.)



\section{Discussion}

explain and regret need for candidate generators

maybe analyse contribution of individual candidate generators (like feature ablation)?
